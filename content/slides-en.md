## A Bold Step Forward

![bg left:33%](./img/arch-1.png)
Statistics Canada is officially embracing open source.

* Transitioning key infrastructure to open source solutions
* Adopting **Arch Linux** as our primary platform
* Making our code and processes publicly available

<blockquote>
This isn't just a technical change—it's a philosophical shift  
toward transparency, collaboration... and rolling updates.
</blockquote>

## Why Arch Linux?

The perfect foundation for our open source journey.

* **Simplicity**: Minimalist design with maximum flexibility
* **Cutting-edge**: Always up-to-date — no LTS waiting rooms here
* **Customization**: Tailored to our exact needs, no bloat
* **Community-driven**: Backed by a passionate, wiki-powered ecosystem

<blockquote>
Arch isn't just a distro—it's a lifestyle.  
#ricingNotRequired (but we might anyway)
</blockquote>

## Benefits of Going Open Source

Transforming how we serve Canadians.

* **Cost efficiency**: No more EULAs or surprise license renewals
* **Security**: Transparency is the best vulnerability scanner
* **Innovation**: AUR of ideas from around the world
* **Sovereignty**: Our system, our rules, our `pacman -Syu`

<blockquote>
Open source gives us the power to build  
exactly what we need—and nothing we don't.

## Aligning with The Zone

This evolution strengthens our existing platform.

* The Zone was open source before it was cool
* Arch integration makes it leaner, meaner, and cleaner
* Together, they create a modern, sovereign digital stack
* Also, our terminals now *look cooler*

<blockquote>
The Zone x Arch:  
Because YAML should be readable and syslogs beautiful.

## Implementation Roadmap

![bg left:33%](./img/arch-4.png)
Our phased approach to open source adoption.

* **Phase 1**: Infrastructure transition (Q3 2025)
* **Phase 2**: Application migration (Q4 2025)
* **Phase 3**: Community engagement (Q1 2026)
* **Phase 4**: Full optimization + rice check (Q2 2026)

<blockquote>
Yes, it's rolling —  
but we're not doing this on a Friday.

Be part of this transformation.

* **Contribute**: Pull requests welcome — just don't break the PKGBUILD
* **Collaborate**: Pair programming in tmux? Let’s go
* **Learn**: The Arch Wiki is life
* **Adopt**: It’s not hard, you just read a little more

<blockquote>
We use Arch not because it’s easy,  
but because it puts us in control.
