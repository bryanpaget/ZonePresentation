###### *A Strategic Approach to Data Infrastructure*

## Core Recommendation

![bg left:33%](./img/strategy.png)

**StatCan must implement a sovereign data platform as our primary infrastructure for sensitive data, with Microsoft Fabric used only for specific, non-sensitive applications.**

<blockquote>
This approach ensures compliance with Canadian law while maintaining world-class analytics capabilities.
</blockquote>

---

## Why Sovereignty Matters

![bg left:33%](./img/compliance.png)

**Legal and Compliance Imperatives**

- **Canadian Law Requirements**: Statistics Act and Privacy Act mandate absolute control over citizen data
- **Government Directives**: Treasury Board requires sensitive data to reside in Canadian sovereign infrastructure
- **Foreign Jurisdiction Risks**: U.S. CLOUD Act allows foreign access to data on commercial clouds

<blockquote>
Non-compliance risks legal challenges, public trust erosion, and national security vulnerabilities.
</blockquote>

## Risk Assessment

![bg left:33%](./img/risk.png)

**Key Risks of Commercial Clouds**

- **Foreign Access**: Commercial providers cannot guarantee zero foreign personnel access
- **Legal Exposure**: Data subject to foreign legal orders and surveillance
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Long-term dependency on proprietary systems
- **Cost Escalation**: Unpredictable pricing models as data volumes grow

<blockquote>
These risks directly conflict with StatCan's mandate to protect Canadian data.
</blockquote>

**Canadian-Hosted Open-Source Platform**

- **Complete Control**: Data physically located in Canada with Canadian-managed infrastructure
- **Full Transparency**: Open-source technology auditable by Canadian experts
- **Cost Efficiency**: 37% lower long-term costs vs. commercial clouds (DFO benchmark)
- **Future-Proof**: Avoids vendor lock-in and enables customization

<blockquote>
Built on proven technology used by global intelligence agencies and financial institutions.
</blockquote>

---

## Enhanced Analytics Capabilities

![bg left:33%](./img/analytics.png)

**World-Class Analytics Without Compromise**

- **Unified Data Access**: Query multiple sources simultaneously without data duplication
- **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning and statistical modeling capabilities
- **Metadata Integration**: Automatic enrichment with statistical context and definitions
- **Scalability**: Handles datasets of any size with enterprise-grade performance

<blockquote>
Matches commercial cloud capabilities while maintaining full sovereignty.
</blockquote>

---

## Microsoft Fabric: Limited Use Cases

![bg left:33%](./img/fabric.png)

**When Fabric is Acceptable**

- **Public Data Only**: Non-sensitive datasets and aggregated statistical outputs
- **External Collaboration**: Partner and public-facing analytics portals
- **Development Environments**: Testing and prototyping non-sensitive applications
- **Strict Controls**: Canadian-managed access with encryption and audit trails

<blockquote>
Fabric remains a tool for specific use cases, not our primary data infrastructure.
</blockquote>

---

## Implementation Approach

![bg left:33%](./img/implementation.png)

**Phased Deployment Strategy**

1. **Foundation**: Deploy sovereign platform using existing infrastructure
2. **Migration**: Gradual transition of sensitive data with zero downtime
3. **Integration**: Connect to existing systems and workflows
4. **Optimization**: Enhance capabilities based on user feedback

<blockquote>
Minimal disruption to operations with clear milestones and success metrics.

| **Concern** | **Our Response** |
|-------------|------------------|
| *"Commercial clouds are more secure"* | Sovereign platform meets or exceeds security standards with Canadian control |
| *"Self-hosted is too expensive"* | Lower long-term costs with predictable pricing and no vendor lock-in |
| *"We'll fall behind on innovation"* | Open-source innovates faster and can be customized to Canadian needs |
| *"Implementation is too complex"* | Proven methodology with expert partners and clear project management |
