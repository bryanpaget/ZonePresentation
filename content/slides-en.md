<!-- Our Story / History -->
## Our Story

**One Platform, Two Zones**

![bg left:33%](./img/zone-1.png)

- The Advanced Analytics Workspace (AAW)
  was the first Zone
- The Zone is its Protected B counterpart
- Built on the same foundation:
  **Kubeflow on Kubernetes**

<blockquote>
Same core. Same capabilities.
<br>
Higher security.
</blockquote>

---

<!-- What is The Zone? -->
## What Is The Zone?

![bg left:33%](./img/zone-1.png)

The Zone is a data science platform based on **Kubeflow**, designed to orchestrate notebooks, jobs, and machine learning workflows.

Featuring:

- **JupyterLab** supporting Python, R, SAS, Julia
- **Kubeflow** for scalable infrastructure for data science and automation

<blockquote>
The Zone is a platform that runs on Azure AKS
<br>
but can run on any Kubernetes cluster.
</blockquote>

<!-- Inclusivity & SAS Coexistence -->
## Everyone Is Welcome

![bg left:33%](./img/zone-3.png)

### Which Language? No Barrier.

- Python, R, Julia, SAS are all supported
- Migrate at your pace, in your language
- **The only platform at StatCan where
SAS and Python/R coexist**

<!-- Inclusivity & SAS Coexistence -->
## Everyone Is Welcome

![bg left:33%](./img/zone-3.png)

### Which Organization? No Barrier.

- Open source by design: cloneable, shareable, federatable
- We've already done it once: we can do it again
- Ready to support other teams, departments, and levels of government

<!-- Why Created -->
## Why Was The Zone Created?

![bg left:33%](./img/zone-5.png)

To deliver a secure, modern, and independent data platform.

- Provide a **Protected B compliant** environment
- Reduce reliance on proprietary tools
- Long-term cost reduction through reusable, open infrastructure

<blockquote>
This is about sovereignty, sustainability, and
<br>
self-reliance.
</blockquote>

---

<!-- Platform Strengths -->
## What We've Built

![bg left:33%](./img/zone-5.png)

- Over 2,200 onboarded users
- 130+ daily notebook sessions
- CronJobs powering real production workflows
- A stable, proven platform used across divisions

<br>

<blockquote>
This is not a prototype.
This is production grade.
</blockquote>

<!-- Summer 2025 -->
## Summer 2025

![bg left:33%](./img/zone-8.png)

- **MKL** acceleration for faster numerical computing
- **Tesseract OCR** to extract text from scanned documents
- **Volume and namespace cleaners** for automatic resource cleanup
- **CronJobs** for scheduling our pipeline-ready infrastructure
- **Readiness Probe**: no more loading errors
- **Optimized Docker** images for faster load times

---

<!-- From Cron to Pipeline -->
## From CronJobs to Pipelines

![bg left:33%](./img/zone-8.png)

**Today:** CronJobs run in isolation.

**Tomorrow:** Connected, observable workflows powered by **Argo Workflows** and **Kubeflow Pipelines**.

- Argo Workflows orchestrates complex job sequences on Kubernetes
- Kubeflow Pipelines enable end-to-end ML workflows with UI, caching, versioning
- Full logging, retry logic, error handling, triggers

<blockquote>
Automation, evolved.

<!-- Future: Kubernetes Is Built for Orchestration -->
## Kubernetes Is Built for Orchestration

![bg left:33%](./img/zone-9.png)

At its core, **Kubernetes is designed to orchestrate workloads**: scaling, scheduling, and managing containers across clusters.

- Powers modern cloud-native apps
- Handles complex workflows reliably
- Already runs The Zone's notebooks and jobs

<blockquote>
Orchestration isn't the future.
<br>
It's already here, under the hood.
</blockquote>

---

<!-- Future: Kubeflow Brings Orchestration to Data Science -->
## Kubeflow Brings Orchestration to Data Scientists

![bg left:33%](./img/zone-9.png)

**Kubeflow was built for pipelines.** It brings Kubernetes' power to data scientists through an intuitive interface.

- The AAW had **Kubeflow Pipelines**, **Argo Workflows**
- We can re-enable them, no reinvention needed, for end-to-end workflows: versioned, reproducible, monitored

<blockquote>
We're not starting from scratch. We're restoring what works and making it secure, scalable, standard.
</blockquote>

---

<!-- Data Access -->
## Challenges Remain

![bg left:33%](./img/zone-9.png)

- Database connections (workload intake forms)
- Legacy filer performance (data migration)
- Linux and Kubernetes concepts (education)
- Secrets management (Keycloak)
- VS Code extension repo (org wide)

<blockquote>
We're solving these, with your feedback.
</blockquote>

<!-- Portability & Federated Future -->
## A Federated Future

![bg left:33%](./img/zone-10.png)

The Zone is open source and designed to scale. It can be deployed by:

- Other teams at StatCan
- Federal departments
- Provincial and municipal governments

<blockquote>
Same foundation. Same security.
<br>
Deployed where you need it.
</blockquote>
