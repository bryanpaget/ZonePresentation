<!-- Who We Are -->
## The Zone Team – Summer 2025

![bg right:33%](./zone-0.png)

We are the team building and supporting The Zone:

- Souheil, Mathis, Jose, Wendy, Bryan  
- Co-op Students: Justin and Anray  
- Dedicated to modern, secure, and open data science

> We design, develop, and support a platform that works — for everyone.

<!-- Our Story / History -->
## Our Story: One Platform, Two Zones

![bg right:33%](./zone-1.png)

The journey began with the **Advanced Analytics Workspace (AAW)** — an open, external environment for innovation.

Now, **The Zone** brings that same power inside StatCan, as a **Protected B compliant** platform.

- Same foundation: **Kubeflow on Kubernetes**  
- Same user experience, enhanced security  
- Proven portability: we’ve already migrated workloads and users

> Same core capabilities, higher security  
> A proven foundation for modern analytics

<!-- What is The Zone? -->
## What Is The Zone?

![bg right:33%](./zone-2.png)

The Zone is a secure, scalable data science platform built for real-world analytics.

It features:

- Multilingual JupyterLab environments (Python, R, SAS, Julia)  
- Scalable compute for individuals and teams  
- Cloud-native architecture on **Azure AKS**  
- Designed to run anywhere with Kubernetes

> Orchestrating notebooks, jobs, and ML workflows  
> Not locked to a cloud — built for flexibility

---

<!-- Inclusivity & SAS Coexistence -->
## Everyone Is Welcome

![bg right:33%](./zone-3.png)

### Language? No Barrier.

- Python, R, Julia, SAS — all supported  
- Migrate at your own pace, in your preferred language  
- The only platform at StatCan where **SAS and Python/R coexist**

Protect legacy code while growing into open source.

> Your language. Your pace. Our platform.

<!-- Platform Strengths -->
## Production Proven Platform

![bg right:33%](./zone-5.png)

The Zone is not a pilot. It’s in production — and growing.

- Over **2,200 registered users**  
- **130+ daily notebook sessions**  
- CronJobs powering real workflows across divisions

Teams use it for research, automation, modeling, and reporting.

> Not a prototype — production analytics  
> infrastructure serving StatCan every day

## Summer 2025: Enhanced Capabilities

![bg right:33%](./zone-6.png)

We are continuously improving The Zone:

- **MKL acceleration**: faster numerical computing for Python and R  
- **Tesseract OCR**: extract text from scanned documents and PDFs  
- **Automated cleanup systems**: reclaim storage with volume and namespace cleaners  
- **Pipeline-ready infrastructure**: one step from scripts to orchestrated workflows

> Performance, efficiency, and readiness  
> all continuously improving

<!-- From Cron to Pipeline -->
## Evolving to Orchestrated Workflows

![bg right:33%](./zone-7.png)

Today, many workflows run as isolated CronJobs.

Tomorrow, we move to **connected, observable pipelines**:

- **Argo Workflows**: orchestrates complex sequences on Kubernetes  
- **Kubeflow Pipelines**: enables end-to-end ML workflows with UI, caching, and versioning  
- Full logging, retry logic, error handling, and monitoring  
- Visualize every step from data to model to deployment

> Visualize and monitor every step  
> from data to deployment

<!-- Future: Kubernetes Foundation -->
## Built on an Orchestration Foundation

![bg right:33%](./zone-8.png)

At its core, **Kubernetes is designed for orchestration**.

- It schedules, scales, and manages containers across clusters  
- Powers modern cloud-native applications  
- Already runs notebooks and CronJobs in The Zone  

This isn’t experimental — it’s battle-tested infrastructure.

> Orchestration isn't the future —  
> it's already here, powering The Zone

<!-- Future: Kubeflow Brings Orchestration to Data Science -->
## Kubeflow Brings Orchestration to Data Scientists

![bg right:33%](./zone-9.png)

**Kubeflow was built for pipelines.**  
It brings Kubernetes’ power to data scientists — through a clean, intuitive interface.

- The AAW successfully used **Kubeflow Pipelines** and **Argo Workflows**  
- We can re-enable them in The Zone — no reinvention needed  
- End-to-end workflows: Data -> Model -> Deployment  
- Versioned, reproducible, monitored  
- CI/CD practices for data science, including retraining and drift detection  

> We’re not starting over.  
> We’re restoring what works — and making it secure, scalable, and standard.

<!-- Federated Future -->
## A Federated Future Awaits

![bg right:33%](./zone-10.png)

The Zone is open source by design — built to spread.

It can be deployed by:

- Other teams within StatCan  
- Federal departments (ESDC, ISED, DND, Health Canada)  
- Provincial and municipal governments  

No need to rebuild. Just clone, configure, and go.

> Same foundation. Same security.  
> Deployed where you need it.
