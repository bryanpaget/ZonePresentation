<!-- Our Story / History -->
## The Story So Far

![bg right:33%](./zone-0.png)

- **Born from AAW (Advanced Analytics Workspace)** an open, external platform for innovation  
- **The Zone** launched as its secure twin: internal, **Protected B compliant**  
- Built using the same core: **Kubeflow on Kubernetes**  
- We **cloned, migrated, and proved portability** once, and are at it again

> Same foundation. New level of security.

<!-- What is The Zone? -->
## What Is The Zone?

![bg right:33%](./zone-0.png)

**The Zone is a modern data science platform** built on **Kubeflow**, running on **Azure AKS** but designed to run anywhere Kubernetes exists.

It provides:

- **Multilingual JupyterLab environments** (Python, R, SAS, Julia)  
- **Notebooks, jobs, and pipelines** in one place  
- **Scalable compute** for individuals and teams  
- **Orchestration** for ML, data science, and ETL workflows

> Think of it as **your lab, your cluster, your rules, securely hosted**.

<!-- Why Created -->
## Why Was The Zone Created?

![bg right:33%](./zone-1.png)

To give StatCan a **secure, compliant, and modern environment** for data science without sacrificing openness or innovation.

- Needed a **Protected B** alternative to AAW 
- Teams required **flexibility** in tools and languages  
- Wanted **reproducibility, automation, and scalability**

> The Zone bridges innovation and compliance.

## This Summer: Stronger, Smarter, Safer

![bg right:33%](./zone-2.png)

We're not just maintaining, we're improving:

- **MKL acceleration**: faster numerical computing  
- **Tesseract OCR**: extract text from scanned documents  
- **Volume & Namespace Cleaners**: automatic resource cleanup  
- **Pipeline-ready infrastructure**: preparing for full workflow orchestration

> Better performance. Less clutter. More capability.

<!-- Limitations & Pain Points -->
## Current Challenges

![bg right:33%](./zone-3.png)

We're honest about our pain points:

- **File stability and performance**: legacy tech interfacing with modern platform, this won't last forever  
- **Onboarding delays**: database access takes time, need a better network access model to connect new sources of data and metadata
- **New environment**: need some workshops to build knowledge in house
- **Secrets management**: still evolving (e.g. Keycloak integration)
- **VS Code extension management**: we add exentensions manually, need an organizational wide solution

> We're actively working on solutions with your feedback.

<!-- Future -->
## The Future of The Zone

![bg right:33%](./zone-4.png)

Our roadmap is ambitious:

- **More workshops & training** â€“ from beginner to advanced  
- **From CronJobs to Pipelines** â€“ connected, observable workflows  
- **Federated deployment** â€“ ready to be adopted across:

  - **Federal departments**  
  - **Provincial agencies**  
  - **Municipal partners**

> Same platform. Same standards.  
> Deployed where you need it.
