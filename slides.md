<!-- Who We Are -->
## The Zone Team – Summer 2025

![bg right:30%](./zone-0.png)

We are the team building and supporting The Zone:

- Souheil, Mathis, Jose, Wendy, Bryan
- Summer Co-op Students: Justin and Anray

<!-- Our Story / History -->
## Our Story: One Platform, Two Zones

![bg right:30%](./zone-1.png)

- The Advanced Analytics Workspace (AAW) was the first Zone
- The Zone is its Protected B counterpart
- Built on the same foundation: **Kubeflow on Kubernetes**  

> Same core. Same capabilities. Higher security.

---

<!-- What is The Zone? -->
## What Is The Zone?

![bg right:30%](./zone-2.png)

The Zone is a data science platform based on **Kubeflow**, running on **Azure AKS**, designed to orchestrate notebooks, jobs, and machine learning workflows.

- Multilingual JupyterLab environments (Python, R, SAS, Julia)  
- Secure compute for individuals and teams  
- Scalable infrastructure for data science and automation  
- A platform that runs on Azure but can run on any Kubernetes cluster

<!-- Inclusivity & SAS Coexistence -->
## Everyone Is Welcome

![bg right:30%](./zone-3.png)

### Language? No Barrier.

- Python, R, Julia, SAS are all supported  
- Multilingual Jupyter kernels  
- Migrate at your pace, in your language  
- The only platform at StatCan where **SAS and Python/R coexist**

### Organization? No Barrier.

- Open source by design: cloneable, shareable, federatable  
- We've already done it once: we can do it again  
- Ready to support other teams, departments, and levels of government

<!-- Why Created -->
## Why Was The Zone Created?

![bg right:30%](./zone-4.png)

To deliver a secure, modern, and independent data platform.

- Provide a **Protected B compliant** environment for sensitive data  
- Reduce reliance on proprietary and external tools  
- Cut long-term costs through reusable, open infrastructure  
- Empower teams with full control over their workflows

> This is about sovereignty, sustainability, and self-reliance.

---

<!-- Platform Strengths -->
## What We've Built

![bg right:30%](./zone-5.png)

- Over 2,200 users  
- 130+ daily notebook sessions  
- CronJobs powering real production workflows  
- A stable, proven platform used across divisions

> This is not a prototype.  
> This is production-grade analytics infrastructure.

<!-- Summer 2025 -->
## Summer 2025: Stronger, Smarter, Safer

![bg right:30%](./zone-6.png)

We are evolving:

- MKL acceleration for faster numerical computing  
- Tesseract OCR to extract text from scanned documents  
- Volume and namespace cleaners for automatic resource cleanup  
- Pipeline-ready infrastructure, one step from scripts to workflows

> Performance, efficiency, and readiness, all improving.

---

<!-- From Cron to Pipeline -->
## From CronJobs to Pipelines

![bg right:30%](./zone-7.png)

Today: scheduled scripts run in isolation.

Tomorrow: connected, observable workflows powered by **Argo Workflows** and **Kubeflow Pipelines**.

- Argo Workflows orchestrates complex job sequences on Kubernetes  
- Kubeflow Pipelines enables end-to-end ML workflows with UI, caching, and versioning  
- Full logging, retry logic, error handling, and trigger-based execution  
- Visualize and monitor every step from data to model

---

<!-- Future: Kubeflow Pipelines -->
## The Future: MLOps at Scale

![bg right:30%](./zone-8.png)

We are moving toward end-to-end reproducible workflows:

- The AAW previously supported **Kubeflow Pipelines** and **Argo Workflows** — we can bring them back to The Zone  
- Data -> Model -> Deployment, fully tracked and versioned  
- CI/CD practices applied to data science pipelines  
- Models monitored in production, with drift detection and retraining

---

<!-- Data Access -->
## Breaking Down Barriers

![bg right:30%](./zone-9.png)

Challenges remain:

- Database onboarding is slow due to network policies  
- Legacy filer performance can constrain projects  
- Some users find Kubernetes concepts unfamiliar  
- Org-wide secrets management still in development

---

<!-- Portability & Federated Future -->
## A Federated Future

![bg right:30%](./zone-10.png)

The Zone is open source and designed to scale and can be deployed by:

- Other teams at StatCan  
- Federal departments (ESDC, ISED, DND, Health Canada)  
- Provincial and municipal governments

> Same foundation. Same security.  
> Deployed where you need it.
