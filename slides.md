<!-- Our Story / History -->
## Our Story: One Platform, Two Zones

![bg right:33%](./zone-1.png)

- The Advanced Analytics Workspace was first
- The Zone is its Protected B counterpart
- Both built on Kubeflow and Kubernetes

> Same core capabilities, higher security  
> Proven foundation for modern analytics

Today: scheduled scripts in isolation

Tomorrow: connected workflows featuring:
- Argo Workflows for complex orchestration
- Kubeflow Pipelines for ML workflows
- Full logging, retry logic, and monitoring

> Visualize and monitor every step  
> from data to deployment

---

<!-- Future: Kubernetes Foundation -->
## Built on Orchestration Foundation

![bg right:33%](./zone-8.png)

Kubernetes: designed for workload orchestration
- Powers modern cloud-native applications
- Handles complex workflows with reliability
- Already runs notebooks and CronJobs

> Orchestration isn't the future -  
> it's already here, powering The Zone

---

<!-- Federated Future -->
## A Federated Future Awaits

![bg right:33%](./zone-10.png)

Open source by design enables:
- Deployment by other StatCan teams
