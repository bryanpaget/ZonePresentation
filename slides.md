<!-- Who We Are -->
## The Zone Team
**Summer 2025**

<br>

![bg right:40%](./zone-0.png)

We are the team building and supporting The Zone:

- Souheil, Mathis, Jose, Wendy, Bryan
- Co-op Students: Justin and Anray

<!-- Our Story / History -->
## Our Story

**One Platform, Two Zones**

<br>

![bg left:36%](./zone-1.png)

- The Advanced Analytics Workspace (AAW) was the first Zone
- The Zone is its Protected B counterpart
- Built on the same foundation:
**Kubeflow on Kubernetes**  

> Same core. Same capabilities. Higher security.

---

<!-- What is The Zone? -->
## What Is The Zone?

![bg left:31%](./zone-2.png)

The Zone is a data science platform based on **Kubeflow**, running on **Azure AKS**, designed to orchestrate notebooks, jobs, and machine learning workflows.

- **JupyterLab** supporting Python, R, SAS, Julia
- **Kubeflow** for Scalable infrastructure for data science and automation
- A platform that runs on Azure but can run on any **Kubernetes** cluster

---

<!-- Inclusivity & SAS Coexistence -->
## Everyone Is Welcome

![bg right:40%](./zone-3.png)

### Language? No Barrier.

<br>

- Python, R, Julia, SAS are all supported
- Migrate at your pace, in your language  
- **The only platform at StatCan where SAS and Python/R coexist**

---

<!-- Inclusivity & SAS Coexistence -->
## Everyone Is Welcome

![bg left:34%](./zone-3.png)

### Organization? No Barrier.

<br>

- Open source by design: cloneable, shareable, federatable  
- We've already done it once: we can do it again
- Ready to support other teams, departments, and levels of government

---

<!-- Why Created -->
## Why Was The Zone Created?

<br>

![bg right:21%](./zone-4.png)

To deliver a secure, modern, and independent data platform.

- Provide a **Protected B compliant** environment
- Reduce reliance on proprietary tools  
- Long-term cost reduction through reusable, open infrastructure  

<br>

> This is about sovereignty, sustainability, and self-reliance.

---

<!-- Platform Strengths -->
## What We've Built

<br>

![bg right:30%](./zone-5.png)

- Over 2,200 users  
- 130+ daily notebook sessions  
- CronJobs powering real production workflows  
- A stable, proven platform used across divisions

<br>

> This is not a prototype.  

---

<!-- Summer 2025 -->
## Summer 2025

<br>

![bg right:28%](./zone-6.png)

- **MKL** acceleration for faster numerical computing  
- Tesseract **OCR** to extract text from scanned documents  
- **Volume and namespace cleaners** for automatic resource cleanup  
- **CronJobs** for scheduling our pipeline-ready infrastructure

---

<!-- From Cron to Pipeline -->
## From CronJobs to Pipelines

<br>

![bg left:25%](./zone-7.png)

Today: CronJobs run in isolation.

Tomorrow: connected, observable workflows powered by **Argo Workflows** and **Kubeflow Pipelines**.

- Argo Workflows orchestrates complex job sequences on Kubernetes  
- Kubeflow Pipelines enables end-to-end ML workflows with UI, caching, and versioning  
- Full logging, retry logic, error handling, and trigger-based execution  

---

<!-- Future: Kubernetes Is Built for Orchestration -->
## Kubernetes Is Built for Orchestration

<br>

![bg right:20%](./zone-8.png)

At its core, **Kubernetes is designed to orchestrate workloads**: scaling, scheduling, and managing containers across clusters.

- It powers modern cloud-native applications  
- Handles complex workflows with reliability and resilience  
- Already runs The Zone's notebooks and CronJobs  

<br>

> Orchestration isn't the future.  
> It's already here, under the hood.

---

<!-- Future: Kubeflow Brings Orchestration to Data Science -->
## Kubeflow Brings Orchestration to Data Scientists

<br>

![bg right:20%](./zone-8.png)

**Kubeflow was built for pipelines.** It brings Kubernetes' power to data scientists, through a clean, intuitive interface.

- The AAW used **Kubeflow Pipelines** and **Argo Workflows**
- We can re-enable them in The Zone, no reinvention needed  
- End-to-end workflows: versioned, reproducible, monitored  

<br>

> We're not starting over. We're restoring what works, and making it secure, scalable, and standard.

---

<!-- Data Access -->
## Challenges Remain

<br>

![bg left:30%](./zone-9.png)

- Database onboarding is slow due to network policies (networking)
- Legacy filer performance can constrain projects (data migration)
- Some users find Kubernetes concepts unfamiliar (education)
- Org-wide secrets management still in development (keycloak)

---

<!-- Portability & Federated Future -->
## A Federated Future

<br>

![bg right:40%](./zone-10.png)

The Zone is open source and designed to scale and can be deployed by:

- Other teams at StatCan  
- Federal departments
- Provincial and municipal governments

<br>

> Same foundation. Same security.  
> Deployed where you need it.
