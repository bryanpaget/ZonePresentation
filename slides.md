# The Zone: A Modern Data Science Platform
![bg right:33%](./zone-1.png)
### Everyone is Welcome
- All languages: Python, R, SAS, and more
- All teams: analysts, devs, data scientists
- Open, secure, and ready to scale
---
<!-- Our Story -->
## Our Story: One Zone, Two Zones, Many?
![bg right:33%](./zone-0.png)
### The AAW Was the First Zone
- Same core: **Kubeflow on Kubernetes**
- AAW = Zone 1: external, open, innovative
- The Zone = Zone 2: internal, more secure, Protected B
- We **cloned and migrated**, proving portability
---
<!-- What is The Zone? -->
## The Zone Is Kubeflow
![bg right:33%](./zone-0.png)
### One Platform. Every Workflow.
- Running on **Azure AKS**
- Kubeflow: a data scientist-friendly layer on Kubernetes
- Notebooks, jobs, pipelines, all in one place
- **Runs anywhere** — public cloud, private cluster, sovereign infrastructure
---
<!-- Inclusivity -->
## Everyone is Welcome
![bg right:33%](./zone-0.png)
### Language? No Barrier.
- Python, R, Julia, SAS, all supported
- Multilingual Jupyter kernels
- Migrate at your pace, in your language

### Organization? No Barrier.
- Open source = **cloneable, shareable, federatable**
- We've already done it once
- Ready to do it again — for other teams, other departments
---
<!-- SAS Migration -->
## SAS to Open Source
![bg right:33%](./zone-0.png)
### Bridging the Gap
- Only platform at StatCan where **SAS + Python/R coexist**
- Protect investments in legacy code
- Grow into open source, together
---
<!-- Platform Strengths -->
## What We've Built
![bg right:33%](./zone-1.png)
### Real Adoption, Real Impact
- 2,200+ users
- 130+ daily notebooks
- CronJobs powering real workflows
---
<!-- Summer 2025 -->
## Summer 2025: Stronger, Smarter, Safer
![bg right:33%](./zone-2.png)
### We didn't just maintain, we evolved.
- **MKL acceleration**: faster math, faster models
- **Tesseract OCR**: unlock scanned documents
- **Volume & Namespace Cleaners**: automatic resource cleanup
- **Pipeline-ready infrastructure**: one step from CronJobs to Pipelines
---
<!-- Portability -->
## Proven Portability
![bg right:33%](././zone-3.png)
### We've Already Moved The Zone
- Cloned AAW (Zone 1) to The Zone (Zone 2)
- Migrated workloads, users, and workflows
- Now moving to an **even more secure cloud environment**
---
<!-- From Cron to Pipeline -->
## From CronJobs to Pipelines
![bg right:33%](./zone-4.png)
### One Step Away
- Today: scheduled scripts
- Tomorrow: **connected, observable workflows**
- Pipelines = jobs in sequence, with logs, retries, triggers
---
<!-- Future: Kubeflow Pipelines -->
## Future: MLOps at Scale
![bg right:33%](./zone-3.png)
### End-to-End Workflows
- Data → Model → Deployment
- Reproducible, versioned, monitored
- CI/CD for data science
---
<!-- Data Access -->
## Connect. Share. Scale.
![bg right:33%](./zone-2.png)
### Breaking Down Barriers
- Improved network model required
- Today: adding databases is slow (network gatekeeping)
- Missing tools: better VS Code extension repo
- Need org-wide secrets management (e.g. Keycloak)
---
<!-- Federated Future -->
## A Federated Future
![bg right:33%](./zone-1.png)
### One Platform. Many Zones.
- The Zone is **open source and reusable**
- We've already cloned it once, we can do it again
- Imagine:  
  - **Health Canada** with their own Zone  
  - **ESDC**, **ISED**, **DND**, each sovereign, secure, self-managed
> Same foundation. Same best practices.  
> Different domains. Shared vision.
