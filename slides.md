<!-- Who We Are -->
## The Zone Team â€“ Summer 2025

![bg right:24%](./zone-0.png)

We are the team building and supporting The Zone:

- Souheil, Mathis, Jose, Wendy, Bryan
- Summer Co-op Students: Justin and Anray  

We are developers, data engineers, and platform advocates committed to open, secure, and sovereign data infrastructure for government.

> We're here to support you and scale with you.

<!-- Our Story / History -->
## Our Story: One Platform, Two Zones

![bg right:24%](./zone-1.png)

- The Advanced Analytics Workspace (AAW) was the first Zone: meant for collaboration 
- The Zone is its secure, internal counterpart, compliant with Protected B  
- Built on the same foundation: **Kubeflow on Kubernetes**  
- We successfully **cloned and migrated** AAW to The Zone, proving portability

> Same architecture. Higher security. Same mission.

<!-- What is The Zone? -->
## What Is The Zone?

![bg right:24%](./zone-1.png)

The Zone is a data science platform based on **Kubeflow**, running on **Azure AKS**, designed to orchestrate notebooks, jobs, and machine learning workflows.

It provides:

- Multilingual JupyterLab environments (Python, R, SAS, Julia)  
- Secure compute for individuals and teams  
- Scalable infrastructure for data science and automation  
- A platform that runs on Azure but can run on any Kubernetes cluster

> This is not vendor lock-in. This is sovereign infrastructure.

<!-- Inclusivity & SAS Coexistence -->
## Everyone Is Welcome

![bg right:24%](./zone-2.png)

### Language? No Barrier.

- Python, R, Julia, SAS are all supported  
- Multilingual Jupyter kernels  
- Migrate at your pace, in your language  
- The only platform at StatCan where **SAS and Python/R coexist**

> Protect legacy investments while growing into open source.

### Organization? No Barrier.

- Open source by design: cloneable, shareable, federatable  
- We've already done it once: we can do it again  
- Ready to support other teams, departments, and levels of government

> This platform is built to spread.

<!-- Why Created -->
## Why Was The Zone Created?

![bg right:24%](./zone-2.png)

To deliver a secure, modern, and independent alternative to commercial and foreign-hosted data platforms.

- Provide a **Protected B compliant** environment for sensitive data  
- Reduce reliance on proprietary and external tools  
- Cut long-term costs through reusable, open infrastructure  
- Empower teams with full control over their workflows

> This is about sovereignty, sustainability, and self-reliance.

<!-- Platform Strengths -->
## What We've Built

![bg right:24%](./zone-3.png)

- Over 2,200 users  
- 130+ daily notebook sessions  
- CronJobs powering real production workflows  
- A stable, proven platform used across divisions

> This is not a prototype.  
> This is production-grade analytics infrastructure.

<!-- Summer 2025 -->
## Summer 2025: Stronger, Smarter, Safer

![bg right:24%](./zone-3.png)

We are evolving:

- MKL acceleration for faster numerical computing  
- Tesseract OCR to extract text from scanned documents  
- Volume and namespace cleaners for automatic resource cleanup  
- Pipeline-ready infrastructure, one step from scripts to workflows

> Performance, efficiency, and readiness, all improving.

<!-- From Cron to Pipeline -->
## From CronJobs to Pipelines

![bg right:24%](./zone-4.png)

Today: scheduled scripts run in isolation.

Tomorrow: connected, observable workflows with:

- Logging and monitoring  
- Retry logic and error handling  
- Trigger-based execution  
- Full traceability from data to model

> Automation, elevated.

---

<!-- Future: Kubeflow Pipelines -->
## The Future: MLOps at Scale

![bg right:24%](./zone-4.png)

We are moving toward end-to-end reproducible workflows:

- Data -> Model -> Deployment  
- Versioned, monitored, and auditable  
- CI/CD practices applied to data science

> This is how government innovates, securely and sustainably.

---

<!-- Data Access -->
## Breaking Down Barriers

![bg right:24%](./zone-4.png)

Challenges remain:

- Database onboarding is slow due to network policies  
- Legacy filer performance can constrain projects  
- Some users find Kubernetes concepts unfamiliar  
- Org-wide secrets management still in development

> We are actively addressing these, with your feedback.

---

<!-- Portability & Federated Future -->
## A Federated Future

![bg right:24%](./zone-0.png)

The Zone is open source and designed to scale.

We've already cloned it once. We can do it again, for:

- Other teams at StatCan  
- Federal departments (ESDC, ISED, DND, Health Canada)  
- Provincial and municipal governments

> Same foundation. Same security.  
> Deployed where you need it.

This is how we build a national platform: together.
