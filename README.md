![](./zone-0.png)

### What You Need to Know

#### One Platform for All Data Science Work

The Zone brings together **Python, R, SAS, and more** in a single, secure environment built on **Kubeflow and Azure AKS**. Whether you're running notebooks, automating jobs, or building models, everything lives in one place, **no more silos, no more friction**.

#### Unique Bridge from Legacy to Future

It's the **only platform at StatCan where SAS and open source coexist**. This means teams can protect their investments in legacy code while safely adopting modern tools and practices, all within a Protected B environment.

#### Built to Scale Across Teams and Organizations

We've already **proven portability** by cloning and migrating from AAW to The Zone. Now, we're paving the way for a **federated future**: one open, reusable platform that can be securely adopted by departments across government, **same foundation, different domains**.
